# Decision Diagrams

This is the implementation of the code for my project course with professor R. Sebastiani of the University of Trento and doctorands G. Spallitta and G. Masina. 
To try out the code just type in the project folder:

```
    python3 main.py
```

When using XSDDs be careful to install https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/psipy instead of the default psipy to use the PSI solver

The dd library was slightly changed to allow for .dot dumping
